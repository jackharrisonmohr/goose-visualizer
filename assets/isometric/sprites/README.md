# Isometric Coder Café Sprites

This directory contains sprite assets for the Coder Café isometric theme in GooseVisualizer.

## Placeholder Sprites

Currently, these are placeholder sprites to demonstrate the coder café theme functionality. In a production environment, these would be replaced with proper artwork.

## Sprite Categories

The sprites are organized into these categories:

1. **Environment** - Floor tiles, walls, windows, doors
2. **Furniture** - Tables, chairs, bookshelves, counter
3. **Agents** - Characters representing different types of developers/AI agents
4. **Tasks** - Visual representations of coding tasks
5. **Messages** - Communication visualizations
6. **Decorative** - Plants, coffee machines, laptops

## File Naming Convention

Files follow this naming pattern:
- `[category]-[name].png` - For static sprites
- `[category]-[name]-[state].png` - For sprites with different states
- `[category]-[name]-sheet.png` - For animation sprite sheets

## Creating New Sprites

When creating new sprites:
1. Use PNG format with transparency
2. Maintain consistent scale (64px width for floor tiles)
3. Use isometric perspective (approximately 2:1 ratio for width:height)
4. Include proper offset for correct positioning
